Intent
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the 
receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
Launch-and-leave requests with a single processing pipeline that contains many possible handlers.
An object-oriented linked list with recursive traversal.

Advantages of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
To reduce the coupling degree. Decoupling it will request the sender and receiver.
Simplified object. The object does not need to know the chain structure.
Enhance flexibility of object assigned duties. By changing the members within the chain or change their order, allow dynamic adding or deleting responsibility.
Increase the request processing new class of very convenient.
DisAdvantages of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

The request must be received not guarantee.
The performance of the system will be affected, but also in the code debugging is not easy may cause cycle call.
It may not be easy to observe the characteristics of operation, due to debug.
